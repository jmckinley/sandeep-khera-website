Years ago, I had to terminate an employee's contract. The decision caused significant emotional distress—sleepless nights, second-guessing, the weight of affecting someone's livelihood.

Years later, I encountered that same individual. What I discovered transformed my understanding of leadership.

## The Unexpected Gift

They held no resentment. In fact, they expressed gratitude for how the situation was handled—with dignity, clarity, and respect.

That encounter taught me something I hadn't fully understood:

> The way we handle others' failures, and indeed our own perceived shortcomings, fundamentally defines the culture we build and the legacy we leave.

## Forgiveness as Leadership Competency

Forgiveness—both extending it to others and practicing self-compassion—represents a vital yet overlooked leadership capability.

It's not about excusing poor performance or avoiding accountability. It's about:

- **Fostering trust** - People take risks when failure isn't catastrophic
- **Building resilience** - Teams recover faster from setbacks
- **Creating humane workplaces** - Where people can be human
- **Enabling growth** - Because mistakes are integral to development

## The Difficult Truth

Mistakes are not just inevitable; they are, in fact, integral to growth.

Leaders who can't forgive create cultures of fear. Leaders who practice forgiveness create cultures of innovation.

## Including Yourself

Don't forget self-compassion. The leaders who are hardest on themselves often struggle to extend grace to others. Forgiveness starts within.

This might be the leadership skill no one talks about. But it might also be one of the most important.
