When I moved to New Zealand early in my career, I encountered a hiring philosophy that puzzled me. Employers emphasized "local relevant experience" over raw capability—a stark contrast from India, where we evaluated candidates based on what they *could* do.

## The Manager Who Saw Beyond

I was fortunate that my manager, Sanjeev Sinha, looked beyond my initial unemployment status. He evaluated my professional merits, sincerity, and ability to work hard. That hiring decision didn't just change my career—it shaped my entire philosophy on recruitment.

## Experience vs. Potential

While experience provides a foundation, potential—demonstrated through the raw hunger to learn, adapt, and innovate—proves invaluable in rapidly evolving sectors like technology.

I've seen it time and again:

- The candidate with the perfect resume who couldn't adapt to change
- The "inexperienced" hire who transformed their department within a year
- The hungry learner who outperformed the seasoned veteran

## What I Look For Now

When I hire today, I look for:

1. **Curiosity** - Do they ask questions that show they're thinking deeply?
2. **Adaptability** - How do they respond to unexpected challenges?
3. **Drive** - Is there genuine hunger to grow and contribute?
4. **Integrity** - Do their values align with the organization's?

Exceptional talent often emerges not from polished resumes but from candidates possessing genuine drive and adaptability. Don't overlook the diamond in the rough—they might become your best hire ever.
