If I could sit down with my younger self—that ambitious, driven person who thought he had it all figured out—here's what I'd say:

## 1. Reframe Failure as Foundation

Those early setbacks—kindergarten rejection, academic struggles—they weren't endpoints. They were catalysts. They built the resilience and humility that proved essential later. Stop viewing failure as the enemy; it's the teacher.

## 2. Productivity Without Presence Isn't Progress

You'll be tempted to wear 80-hour weeks as a badge of honor. Don't. Burnout undermines genuine effectiveness. True productivity requires maintaining physical and mental well-being alongside effort. Learn this now, not after a health crisis.

## 3. Your Journey Isn't a Competition

Stop constantly comparing yourself to peers. This frames your career as a race rather than what it truly is: a personal alignment. Success means honoring your individual values and energy levels, not matching others' trajectories.

## 4. Vulnerability Strengthens Leadership

I battled suicidal thoughts in my twenties. I wish I'd known sooner that acknowledging internal struggles—and seeking help—builds authentic resilience rather than weakness. The strongest leaders I've met are those who can be vulnerable.

## 5. Generosity Yields Greater Fulfillment

Later, when you transition into philanthropic work, you'll find deeper satisfaction than material achievements alone ever provided. Leadership and lasting fulfillment emerge through giving generously. Start sooner.

To everyone navigating the early years: your struggles aren't roadblocks. They're building blocks.
