I couldn't sleep for days. The conversation I was about to have would end someone's career at our company—a serious breach of policy that left no other option.

## The Weight of Difficult Conversations

HR prepared me for various reactions. They briefed me on procedures, legal considerations, potential responses. But what kept me up at night wasn't the process—it was the humanity of it all.

This was a person with a family, a mortgage, dreams for the future. And I was about to deliver news that would upend all of it.

## My Guiding Principles

Through sleepless nights, I kept returning to what mattered most: maintaining a clear conscience, free of guilt, and a heart overflowing with blessings. Not platitudes—principles to guide me through the hardest conversation of my career.

## How I Approached It

1. **Present the facts clearly** - No ambiguity, no sugar-coating, but no cruelty either
2. **Express genuine regret** - This wasn't a victory; it was a loss for everyone
3. **Offer personal support** - Within appropriate boundaries, extend human kindness

The conversation was exactly as difficult as I'd feared. But I left knowing I had treated another human being with dignity, even while enforcing necessary consequences.

## The Lesson

Hard feedback, delivered poorly, destroys trust and breeds resentment. Hard feedback, delivered with compassion and integrity, maintains your moral authority while respecting the other person's humanity.

You can hold people accountable AND treat them with kindness. In fact, that's the only way to do it right.
