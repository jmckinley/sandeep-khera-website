Bonuses are nice. But the recognition that stays with you forever? That's something different entirely.

## A Moment I'll Never Forget

After successfully migrating a Mongolian bank's core system from English to Mongolian, the company's Chairman approached me. His words still resonate:

> "Sammy, you have given eyes to my staff members."

No bonus could have matched the impact of that sincere acknowledgment. He saw beyond the technical achievement to the human impact—his staff could now work in their own language, with dignity and ease.

## Why Recognition Matters More Than Money

Authentic appreciation, sincerely articulated with visibility of work's direct impact, proves more motivating than monetary compensation. Here's why:

1. **It validates human contribution** - Not just output, but effort and intention
2. **It fosters loyalty** - People remember how you made them feel
3. **It ignites passion** - Knowing your work matters fuels greater commitment
4. **It strengthens team cohesion** - Recognition creates a culture of appreciation

## How to Recognize Meaningfully

- Be specific about what they did and why it mattered
- Connect their work to its broader impact
- Make it personal, not formulaic
- Do it promptly, while the achievement is fresh
- Consider public recognition for significant contributions

The best leaders I've known understand this: people don't just work for money. They work for meaning. Give them that, and you'll have their hearts, not just their time.
