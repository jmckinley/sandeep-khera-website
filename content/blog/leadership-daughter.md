# What My Daughter Taught Me About Leadership

The boardroom and the living room have more in common than you might think.

## A Lesson in Patience

My daughter was struggling with her math homework. My first instinct—honed by years of corporate problem-solving—was to show her the answer. Get it done. Move on to the next task.

But she stopped me: "Papa, I want to figure it out myself. Just stay here with me."

In that moment, she taught me something I'd forgotten in the rush of executive life: **presence matters more than solutions.**

## The Parallels to Team Leadership

How often do we, as leaders, jump in to "fix" problems for our teams? We think we're helping, but we're actually:

- Robbing them of learning opportunities
- Creating dependency instead of capability
- Signaling that we don't trust their abilities

### What Children Need (And Employees Too)

1. **To be heard** - Not just listened to, but truly understood
2. **Space to fail** - Failure in a safe environment is growth
3. **Unconditional support** - Belief in them, especially when they don't believe in themselves
4. **Clear boundaries with freedom within** - Structure that enables, not restricts

## The "Just Stay Here" Principle

Now, when a team member comes to me with a challenge, I ask myself: "Do they need my solution, or do they need my presence?"

More often than not, they need someone who believes in them while they work through it themselves.

## Reflection

The most profound leadership lessons often come from the most unexpected teachers. My daughter, at 10 years old, reminded me that leadership isn't about having all the answers—it's about creating the conditions for others to find theirs.
