During my corporate years in Singapore, I pursued results with relentless intensity. Eighteen-hour days. Constant stress. Achievement as the sole measure of worth.

My philosophy reflected this intensity: "The job is never done unless it is done." I rejected the concept of work-life balance entirely. I treated my demanding schedule as a badge of honor.

## The Wake-Up Call

This unsustainable approach ultimately culminated in a serious health crisis—a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

The illness was, in its own painful way, a profound wake-up call. It forced me to confront the damaging effects of unmanaged stress and to question everything I believed about success.

## What I Learned

Genuine fulfillment and effective leadership extend far beyond external achievements. True success requires nurturing overall well-being and recognizing a difficult truth:

**Productivity without genuine presence is merely survival.**

## A Different Approach

Now I understand that:

- Results matter, but not at the cost of your health
- Sustainable performance beats burnout-fueled sprints
- Being present—truly present—creates more value than exhausted overwork
- Your worth isn't determined by your output

## The Question I Ask Now

Instead of "How much can I achieve?" I now ask: "How can I achieve sustainably, with presence and purpose?"

The answer has made all the difference.
