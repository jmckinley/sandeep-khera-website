After decades in demanding corporate roles, I've learned that motivation isn't constant. It fluctuates. The question isn't how to maintain perpetual enthusiasm—that's unrealistic. The question is how to re-engage when motivation drops.

Here's what actually works for me.

## 1. Reconnect with Purpose

When motivation wanes, I revisit the "why" behind my work. I recall meaningful impacts—helping teams in Mongolia, contributing to philanthropic work, the specific people whose lives changed because of something I did.

Purpose isn't abstract. It's specific. Find your specific stories.

## 2. Physical Reconnection

I incorporate short walks and deep breathing. Movement shifts mental state. There's wisdom in the phrase: "Physical pain is inevitable, suffering is optional."

Sometimes the body needs to move before the mind can engage.

## 3. Karma Yoga Philosophy

I adopt a detached approach to work by focusing on the action itself rather than immediate outcomes. This approach brings a profound sense of peace and renewed purpose.

Do the work for its own sake, not for what you'll get from it. Paradoxically, this often produces better results.

## Conscious Re-engagement

The key isn't forcing enthusiasm or pushing through with gritted teeth. It's conscious re-engagement—actively choosing to reconnect with what matters rather than merely surviving the workday.

Motivation will drop. That's normal. What you do when it drops determines what happens next.
