# The Day I Survived a Crash, and Everything Changed

**April 24, 2020.** A date I'll never forget.

## The Moment

I was driving on the highway when a truck lost control. In the seconds that followed—seconds that felt like hours—my car spun, collided, and came to rest against the barrier.

When I opened my eyes, I was alive. Shaken, bruised, but alive.

## The Silence After

In the hospital that night, surrounded by the beeping of monitors, I had a clarity I'd never experienced before. All the things I'd been chasing—the next promotion, the bigger deal, the impressive title—seemed suddenly small.

### What Mattered

- The sound of my daughter's voice on the phone
- My wife's hand holding mine
- The simple act of breathing

## The Questions That Followed

In the weeks of recovery, I couldn't stop asking myself:

1. **If that had been my last day, would I have been proud of how I'd lived?**
2. **Was I spending my time on what truly mattered?**
3. **Who was I when I stripped away the titles and achievements?**

The honest answers were uncomfortable.

## The Transformation

That crash didn't just change my perspective—it changed my life's direction. Within a year, I:

- Left my corporate executive role
- Started my coaching practice
- Wrote my book
- Reconnected with what made me feel alive

> "Sometimes the universe doesn't whisper. Sometimes it crashes into you."

## What I Want You to Know

You don't need a near-death experience to wake up. You can choose today to ask yourself the hard questions:

- What would you regret not doing?
- Who deserves more of your time?
- What dream have you been postponing?

The answers are waiting. The only question is whether you're ready to hear them.
