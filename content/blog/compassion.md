Some lessons embed themselves so deeply that they shape everything that follows. For me, one such lesson came from a childhood mistake and my father's response to it.

## The Incident

During a moment of youthful defiance and careless play, I inadvertently ruined a poor family's dinner. I can still remember the look on their faces. It affected me deeply.

## My Father's Words

That evening, my father sat me down. His words proved transformative:

> "Beta (son), remember, never harm the poor. God will punish you for this."

No lecture. No prolonged punishment. Just a clear articulation of responsibility toward those with fewer resources. That guidance has stayed with me for decades.

## What Compassion Really Means

Genuine compassion transcends corporate initiatives and grand gestures. It's not about the donation check or the CSR program—though those matter too.

Authentic empathy requires:

- Recognizing how even minor actions create meaningful consequences
- Understanding the ripple effects of our behaviors
- Paying particular attention to how we treat vulnerable populations
- Building awareness into daily decisions, not just special occasions

## The Leadership Connection

This understanding constitutes essential training for ethical leadership. The best leaders I've known carry this awareness with them—a constant attentiveness to how their decisions affect others, especially those with less power.

Kindness and empathy aren't soft skills. They're the foundation of leading effectively and responsibly.
