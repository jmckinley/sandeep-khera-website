My formative years were defined by intense competition. IIT entrance exams. Corporate ladders. Performance rankings. I learned early that comparison was the lens through which success was measured.

It took me years to realize how counterproductive that lens had become.

## The Debilitating Distraction

Fixating on others' perceived success creates a debilitating distraction. You're so busy watching their race that you lose sight of your own path.

Here's what I've come to believe:

> Your career, and indeed your life, isn't a frantic race against others; it is a deeply personal and evolving conversation with yourself.

## The Inward Turn

Instead of external benchmarking, a far more powerful approach involves turning inward:

- **Understanding your unique strengths** - What do you do that feels effortless?
- **Clarifying your core values** - What matters most to you, really?
- **Identifying what energizes you** - What work makes time disappear?
- **Recognizing what authentically matters** - What sets your soul on fire?

## Finding Your Path

When you align with your genuine values and purpose, the right path reveals itself. Not someone else's path. Yours.

The comparison game has no winners—only people who've forgotten they're running their own race.

Stop comparing. Start noticing what's true for you.
